- üì´ How to reach me ...

Yeah... I'm keeping the unedited GitHub README file as is. I don't want to modify it... 
I first edited this document on my very first day, and I already feel nostalgic about the stuff I receive when I first joined.

I always had a fixation with technology. I wish I spared some time a day to actually develop some code to eventually compile as a game.
Yes, I also love video games! My first experience with actually wanting a video game system was... the Wii U. Because of one single game.
But that game made me want to explore the rest of the console library! The issue: the console was expensive, especially in my home country.
And almost no one, even in my home city, offered support for the Wii U... though they did support the Wii!
This got me thinking. If I can't get a Wii U, I could get a Wii, and maybe have the same level of fun I would have with the former!
One day, the year after I discovered the Wii U, I finally got a Wii! Aaand the experience was not what I expected.
When people say "the Wii is just a more powerful GameCube", they might be right, but I still take it as an offence.
And the shovelware. Dear god, the shovelware!
My Wii came with a hard drive filled with games, but most of them were low quality. And there were no games beyond 2010 when I first got the console!
...But yeah, I still had fun with my Wii... though nowadays I'm starting to regret that decision. My brother wanted a Switch so much, we eventually bought one.

Until 2018/2019, I was essentially a Nintendo fanboy. I would shrivel in hatred every time someone mentioned the PlayStation 2.
It was the top selling console of all time, one of the only consoles Brazilians could recognise, and almost every unit sold here was capable of running pirated discs.
Yeah, those were my motives for my hatred of the PS2. I would eventually like it again, but not until I also grew an obsession for the original Xbox.
Like the Wii U and the Gamecube, the original Xbox is uncommon in my country. You can't find a good offer on these worth less than 1000 reais.
I still don't own it, but I'm desperate to buy one for years.
Oh, about the PS2, I discovered that it had a huge library of impressive games. And for a very common console, it was really affordable!
I bought mine from a from a school friend that was selling it. Though, I couldn't run the games I wanted on it until many months after I got it.

It was around this time that I grew more and more interested on the subject of "homebrew". People created their own applications and ran them on a hacked console.
Pretty much a lot of systems sold in my home country are hacked, and at least on the most popular sale sites, 90% is filled with scalpers who sell common games at full price.
Keep in mind that 60 dollars is about 300 reais, which explains why the market is full of importunous people.
Also, there is the translation issue. Nintendo localised the 3DS and Wii U menus for Brazil, yet never localised first party games.
It wouldn't be until MARIO PARTY SUPERSTARS, in 2021, that they would do this for the first time.
One day, I discovered a community that translates games from English to Portuguese. I thought I could make my own translations for games without one.
As long as it does not replace an existing language... or is not based on the PAL version... and especially the Spanish version!
Jeez, Brazilians still think they don't have an issue reading Spanish content when Portuguese is not available...
This is why a lot of Portuguese content have leftover snippets left in Spanish untranslated!

Oh, the translations? Another thing I also hate is when the localisers completely change the name of the game to Portuguese.
Like, hello! The title of the game is not supposed to be translated! It should be the same in almost all languages!

So yeah, I want to share my own translations (and possibly my own games for old consoles) on the internet. I just need to spare some time to actually work on them.
